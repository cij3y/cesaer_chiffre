Well, honour is the subject of my story, I cannot what you and other men Think of this life; but for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you: We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter,s cold as well as he: For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me'Darest thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into thisangry flood, And swim to yonder point?' Upon the world, Accoutred as i was, I plunged in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrentt roar'd, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, thowing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy; But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar dried 'Hlp me, Cassius, or I sink!' I, as Aeneas, our great waves of Tiber Did I the flames of Troy upo his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the wretched creature and must bend his body, If Caesar carelessly but nod on him, He had a feverwhen he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did Shake: 'tis true, this god did shake; His cowardlips did from their colour fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan: Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in  their books, Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius, 'As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone."
